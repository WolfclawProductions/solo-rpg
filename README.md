A repository for such things as I may make

The file [index.html](index.html) is a one-page system for allowing a player to play a wretched and alone style game. For the tower-block mechanic, I've tried to implement the 100 d6 simulation detailed [here](https://itch.io/jam/wretched-jam/topic/796498/dice-substitute-for-jenga-towers). The 'salvation' mechanism comes with the ace of hearts. Normally, that involves putting 10 tokens on the ace of hearts, and each turn rolling a die; rolling a six removes them; when they're all gone, salvation arrives. In my 'Whoever Finds This Paper' game, I modified this so that the tokens represent food, and for salvation to arrive, you've got to have enough food to see you through... So you can click the plus or minus buttons as necessary to keep track of tokens.

[Whoever Finds This Paper](Whoever%20Finds%20This%20Paper%20v1.0%20S%20Graham.pdf) - a solo journaling RPG set in the North [and the Franklin Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition).
