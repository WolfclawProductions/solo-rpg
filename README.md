# solo-rpg (Agency & Effect Edition)
A repository forked so I don't break any of Shawn Graham's work. 

The file [index.html](index.html) is a one-page system for allowing a player to play a wretched and alone style game. For the tower-block mechanic, Shawn tried to implement the 100 d6 simulation detailed [here](https://itch.io/jam/wretched-jam/topic/796498/dice-substitute-for-jenga-towers). The 'salvation' mechanism comes with the ace of hearts. Normally, that involves putting 10 tokens on the ace of hearts, and each turn rolling a die; rolling a six removes them; when they're all gone, salvation arrives. In my games, I've modified this so the Ace of Hearts triggers a chance of salvation. Resource management and greater opportunities to express one's agency have been added.
